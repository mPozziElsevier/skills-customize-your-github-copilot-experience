### 🛠️ Build the Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a Python program that lets a player guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. The game should randomly select a word from a list, track guesses, and display progress after each guess.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept single-letter guesses from the user
- Show the current progress (e.g., _ _ a _ _ _)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display a win or lose message at the end

Example:
```text
Word: _ _ _ _ _
Guess a letter: a
Word: _ a _ _ _
Incorrect guesses left: 5
... (continues)
```
